# Scientific-Calculator-with-GUI
I've created scientific calculator with Graphical User Interface using Python, math library and Tkinter for the user interface.

To install Tkinter library in PyCharm you can navigate to Settings > Preferences > Python interpreter > Add New > install Future. 

NOTE For Mac users that will use Tkinter. In Tkinter <bg="clour"> command is not working for buttons background, you can chang it to <insertbackground="colour">!
